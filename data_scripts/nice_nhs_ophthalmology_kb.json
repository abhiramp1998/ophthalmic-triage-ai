    "text": "Lazy eye A lazy eye (amblyopia) is when the vision in 1 eye does not develop properly. Rarely, both eyes can be affected. Symptoms of a lazy eye A lazy eye does not always cause symptoms and is often first diagnosed during an eye test. The main symptoms include: shutting 1 eye or squinting when looking at things eyes pointing in different directions (a squint) not being able to follow an object or person with your eyes tilting your head when looking at something having tired eyes and rubbing your eyes a lot headaches difficulty catching or throwing tripping or falling over a lot blinking a lot Many children do not notice anything wrong with their vision. You can check a younger child's eyes by covering each eye with your hand, 1 at a time. They may complain if you cover their good eye. Older children may say they're not able to see as well with 1 eye and may have problems with reading, writing and drawing. Non-urgent advice: Go to an opticians if: you're worried about your or your child's vision you have not had an eye test for 2 years Find an NHS sight test What happens during an eye test To check if you or your child have a lazy eye, an eye test specialist called an optometrist will usually do an eye test. You'll be asked to look at lights or read letters while different lenses are placed in front of your eyes. To check the health of your eyes, you or your child may be given eye drops so the optometrist can see the back of your eye more clearly. If you or your child needs glasses, you'll be given a prescription. You can take this to any optician. Find out more about eye tests for children Information: NHS eye tests NHS eye tests are free for some people, including: children aged under 18, or under 19 and in full-time education people who have diabetes or glaucoma people on some benefits, including Universal Credit Find out more about free NHS eye tests Treatments for a lazy eye How lazy eye is treated depends on what's causing it. Treatment for a lazy eye aims to improve vision in the weaker eye. This may include: wearing glasses to correct your vision wearing an eye patch over the stronger eye for a few hours a day for several months – these are usually worn with glasses using eye drops to temporarily blur vision in the stronger eye Treatment should ideally start before the age of 7, when vision is still developing. If lazy eye is caused by cataracts or a drooping eyelid, you may need surgery. You may also need to have surgery if you have a squint. This will straighten the eyes and allow them to work together better, but does not improve your vision.

    "text": "Blindness and vision loss In the UK, more than 2 million people are living with sight loss. Of these, around 340,000 are registered as blind or partially sighted. Being told you have a visual impairment that can't be treated can be difficult to come to terms with. Some people go through a process similar to bereavement, where they experience a range of emotions including shock, anger, and denial, before eventually coming to accept their condition. Specialist referral If you're blind or partially sighted, you may be referred to a specialist low-vision clinic, which is often located within a hospital. Staff at the clinic can help you understand your condition and come to terms with your diagnosis. They can also advise you about practical things, such as lighting and vision aids, and let you know about further sources of help and support. Ask your local hospital if they have an Eye Clinic Liaison Officer (ECLO), whose role involves providing support to people with vision loss in eye clinics. Support groups If you're blind or partially sighted, you may find it helpful to contact a support group for people with vision loss. Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) The RNIB is the UK's leading charity for people with vision loss. The RNIB website offers useful information, such as coming to terms with sight loss. The RNIB's helpline is open Monday to Friday from 8am to 8pm and Saturday from 9am to 1pm. The number is 0303 123 9999, with calls costing no more than a standard rate call to an 01 or 02 number. You can also email helpline staff (helpline@rnib.org.uk). The RNIB's website is specially designed for people with sight loss and provides a wide range of useful information and resources, including an online community and RNIB online shop. Other national charities Other national charities that specialise in vision loss and you may find useful include: The Macular Society – helpline: 0300 303 0111 Glaucoma UK – helpline: 01233 648170 or email helpline@glaucoma.uk Retina UK – helpline: 0300 111 4000 or email: helpline@retinauk.org.uk Diabetes UK – 0345 123 2399 or email: info@diabetes.org.uk Blind Veterans UK – 0800 389 7979 Royal Society for Blind Children SeeAbility Thomas Pocklington Trust Local organisations There are also many local voluntary organisations around the country that help and support people with vision problems. You can find local support organisations on the RNIB's Sightline Directory. Registering as blind or partially sighted If your vision has deteriorated to a certain level, you may choose to register as visually impaired. Depending on the severity of your vision loss you'll either be registered as sight impaired (previously \"partially sighted\") or severely sight impaired (previously \"blind\"). Your eye specialist (ophthalmologist) will measure your ability to see detail at a distance (visual acuity) and how much you can see from the side of your eye when looking straight ahead (your field of vision). These measurements will help your ophthalmologist determine whether you're eligible to be certified as sight impaired or severely sight impaired. If you are, they will complete an official certificate with the results of your eye examination. In England and Wales this certificate is called the Certificate of Vision Impairment (CVI), in Scotland it's called the CVI (Scotland) form, and in Northern Ireland it's called an A655. Your ophthalmologist will send a copy of the certificate to you, a copy to your GP and a copy to your local social services department. Upon receiving the certificate, your local social services team will contact you to ask whether you want to be added to its register of visually impaired people. If you say \"yes\" then you become registered. After you're registered, social services will contact you again to arrange for an assessment to be carried out. The aim is to assess your needs and find out what help you require to remain independent, such as help with cleaning and cooking, or help with mobility and transport. Registering as visually impaired isn't compulsory, but it can help you to get a range of benefits, including: benefits to help with any costs relating to your disability or illness a reduction in the TV licence fee help with NHS costs help with Council Tax and tax allowances reduced fees on public transport parking concessions Find out more: RNIB: registering as sight impaired GOV.UK: registering vision impairment as a disability Changes to your home Most visually impaired people can continue to live at home. However, you'll probably need to make some changes to your home, particularly if you live on your own. Below is a list of some important pieces of equipment you may find useful. Big-button telephone – both landline and mobile phones are available from the RNIB online shop. Computer, smartphone or tablet – the internet can provide a real sense of connection to friends and family as well as other people with a visual impairment. It's also a practical way of finding out information and obtaining goods and services. Big-button keyboards, screen display software and text readers are available from the RNIB. Community alarm – this small, wearable device has an alarm button which, if pressed, sends an alarm signal to a response centre, which will alert a nominated friend or carer. Your local authority should be able to provide you with further information. Bright lighting – bright light bulbs and adjustable lights are essential for your home, particularly in the kitchen and the stairs (areas where you're most likely to have an accident). Lighting in and around the home: A guide to better lighting for people with visual impairment by the Thomas Pocklington Trust, contains more information on the importance of lighting. The way your house is painted can also make it easier to find your way around. Using a two-tone contrast approach, such as black and white, can make it easier to tell the difference between nearby objects, such as a door and its handle or the stairs and its handrail. Read more from the RNIB about adapting your home Reading and writing There are several options available if you're having problems reading standard text in books, newspapers and magazines. One of the simplest options is to use a magnifying device that can make print appear bigger to help you read. These can be obtained from a number of places including hospital low-vision services, optometrists, local voluntary organisations, and the RNIB. The RNIB also has a collection of large-print publications you can borrow, as do most libraries. You could also use an e-reader to help you read. E-readers are handheld devices that allow you to download books and subscribe to newspapers and magazines on the internet. You can choose a setting that allows you to display text at a larger size. Or you can use text-to-speech software. The RNIB has more information on text-to-speech in eBooks If you're unable to read at all you could listen to audio recordings. You can sign up to the: RNIB's Newsagent scheme, which provides more than 200 magazine and newspaper titles in different formats, such as online or on CD. RNIB Talking Books Service, where you can download audio books to listen to on your smartphone, tablet or computer or on a device known as a DAISY player. You can also get books on CD or USB stick, delivered to your door. You can also install screen-reading software on your computer that will read out emails, documents and text on the internet. The RNIB has more information about using screen-reading software There are also voice recognition programmes where you speak into a microphone and the software translates what you say into writing. These programmes can also be used to issue commands, such as closing down the internet and moving from one website to another. Braille Some people with severe sight loss, particularly those who've had the problem from a young age, choose to learn Braille. Braille is a writing system where raised dots are used as a substitute for written letters. As well as Braille versions of books and magazines, you can buy Braille display units, which can be attached to computers that allow you to read the text displayed on a computer screen. Braille computer keyboards are also available. The RNIB website has more information about reading and Braille Getting around There are several different methods you can use to get around independently if you have a problem with your vision. Long cane You may find a long cane useful when travelling. These canes are usually foldable and can help you get around by detecting objects in your path. The cane will also make drivers and other pedestrians aware that you have sight loss. To get the most from a long cane, it's a good idea to attend a training course that will teach you how to use it. The charity Guide Dogs has more information about getting around safely with a long cane Guide dogs Guide Dogs has been providing guide dogs for people with vision loss for many years. Guide dogs can help you get around, and provide both a sense of independence and companionship. If you apply for a guide dog, Guide Dogs provide all the essential equipment free of charge and can also offer financial assistance if needed for things like food or vet costs. You don't need to have lost all your sight to benefit from a guide dog and you don't have to be officially registered as blind or partially sighted to apply for one. Guide Dogs has more on applying for a guide dog Guide Dogs also offer a number of other services for people with a visual impairment (even if you don't have a guide dog), such as Help for children and families and mobility training. The Guide Dogs' Sighted guiding service aims to reduce the isolation that many people with sight loss experience, helping to rebuild their confidence and regain their independence. Global positioning system (GPS) A global positioning system (GPS) is a navigational aid that uses signals from satellites to tell you where you are and help plan your journeys. GPS devices are available as standalone units that can be programmed using a Braille keyboard, which tell you your current location and give you directions to where you want to go. If you have a smartphone, there are a number of GPS apps you can download. The RNIB website has more information about using GPS Driving If you're diagnosed with a condition that affects your vision, you have a legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Failure to do so is a crime and can result in a fine of up to £1,000. GOV.UK has more on driving with a disability or a health condition If you're registered as having a sight impairment, the DVLA will assume your driving licence is no longer valid and you'll no longer be able to drive. Exceptions are occasionally made for people with mild vision impairment. If you think this applies to you, then your doctor will need to fill in a DVLA medical information questionnaire. You're only legally allowed to drive if you can read a number plate from a distance of 20 metres (65 feet), and an eye test shows your visual acuity is at least 6/12. You're allowed to wear glasses or contact lenses when reading the plate or letter chart. There are also standards relating to your visual field and driving. If you have a condition that may reduce your visual field, the DVLA may ask you to complete a visual field test to demonstrate you're safe to drive. Technology Technology to help you live well and safely with sight loss is developing all the time. You can read: the RNIB's information on technology and useful products the Guide Dogs' information on technology for visual impairment Employment If you're currently employed and have recently been diagnosed with a visual impairment, you should contact the GOV.UK: Access to Work scheme. Access to Work is a scheme run by Jobcentre Plus that provides advice and support about what equipment and adjustments may be required to enable you to do your job. They also offer a grant to contribute towards the costs of any equipment or training you may need, such as voice recognition software, a Braille keyboard and display unit and a printer that can convert text into Braille (Braille embossers). Depending on the size of the company you work for, the grant can pay for 80% to 100% of costs, up to £10,000. Find out more: RNIB: equality, rights and employment GOV.UK: Jobcentre Plus The Thomas Pocklington Trust: employment You don't have to disclose that you have a visual impairment when applying for a job, but it's usually recommended that you do. If you feel you've been turned down for a job because of your disability, and you were capable of doing the job, you can make a complaint under the Equality Act 2010. Some people with a visual impairment decide to become self-employed, often because it allows them the flexibility to work at home for hours they choose. The RNIB website has more information and advice about equality, rights and employment Regular sight tests If you have vision loss, it's still important to have regular sight tests so your optometrist (eye specialist) can check for further changes in your eyes and give you advice about how to make the best use of your vision.

It needs to be treated quickly to stop it permanently affecting your sight. Symptoms of a detached retina Symptoms of a detached retina include: floaters (dots and lines) or flashes of light in your eye a dark \"curtain\" or shadow in your vision changes to your eyesight, such as blurred vision Urgent advice: Get help from NHS 111 if: floaters (dots and lines) suddenly appear in your vision or suddenly increase in number you get flashes of light in your vision you have a dark \"curtain\" or shadow moving across your vision your vision gets suddenly blurred You can call 111 or get help from 111 online. Treatment for a detached retina You'll be referred to hospital for surgery if tests show your retina may be detached or has started to come away (retinal tear). Surgery will usually stop your vision getting worse. What happens during surgery for a detached retina or tear Recovering from a detached retina Recovery time after surgery for a detached retina varies. But as a general guide, for 2 to 6 weeks after surgery: your vision may be blurry your eye may be sore and red – take paracetamol if you need to you may need to take time off work you may not be able to drive you may need to avoid flying (if you've had a bubble of gas put into your eye) Most people are eventually able to return to all their normal activities. Important Call the hospital or go to A&E if the pain, redness or blurriness gets worse after surgery. You may need further treatment. Causes of a detached retina A detached retina is usually caused by changes to the jelly inside your eye, which can happen as you get older. This is called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). It's not clear exactly why PVD can lead to retinal detachment in some people and there's nothing you can do to prevent it. But it's more likely to happen if you: are short-sighted have had an eye operation (such as cataract surgery) have had an eye injury have a family history of retinal detachment Find out more about posterior vitreous detachment from RNIB Important: If your symptoms come back You can get a detached retina more than once.

    "text": "Eye cancer Around 850 cases of eye cancer (ocular cancer) are diagnosed in the UK each year. There are a number of different types of cancer that affect the eyes, including: eye melanoma squamous cell carcinoma lymphoma retinoblastoma – a childhood cancer Cancer can also sometimes develop in the tissues surrounding your eyeball or spread to the eye from other parts of the body, such as the lungs or breasts. This topic focuses on melanoma of the eye, one of the most common types of eye cancer. There is more information about other types of eye cancer on the Cancer Research UK website. Symptoms of eye cancer Eye cancer does not always cause obvious symptoms and may only be picked up during a routine eye test. Symptoms of eye cancer can include: shadows, flashes of light, or wiggly lines in your vision blurred vision a dark patch in your eye that's getting bigger partial or total loss of vision bulging of 1 eye a lump on your eyelid or in your eye that's increasing in size eye irritation that is not going away pain in or around your eye, although this is rare These symptoms can also be caused by more minor eye conditions, so they're not necessarily a sign of cancer. But it's important to get the symptoms checked by a doctor as soon as possible. Melanoma of the eye Melanoma is cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Most melanomas develop in the skin, but it's also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye. Eye melanoma most commonly affects the eyeball. Doctors sometimes call it uveal or choroidal melanoma, depending on exactly which part of your eye is affected. It can also affect the conjunctiva (the thin layer that covers the front of the eye) or the eyelid. What causes eye melanoma? Eye melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour. It's not clear exactly why this occurs, but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening: lighter eye colour – if you have blue, grey or green eyes, you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared with people who have brown eyes white or pale skin – eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in those with fair skin unusual moles – if you have irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles, you're more at risk of developing melanoma skin cancer and eye melanoma use of sunbeds – there's some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds, for example, can increase your risk of eye melanoma overexposure to sunlight – this increases your risk of skin cancer, and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma The risk of developing eye melanoma also increases with age, with most cases being diagnosed in people in their 50s. There is information about risk factors for other types of eye cancer on the Cancer Research UK website. Diagnosing melanoma of the eye If your GP or optician (optometrist) suspects you have a serious problem with your eyes, they'll refer you to a specialist eye doctor called an ophthalmologist for an assessment. If they suspect you have melanoma of the eye, they'll refer you to a specialist centre for eye cancer. There are 4 centres in the UK, located in London, Sheffield, Liverpool and Glasgow. It's likely you'll have a number of different tests at the centre, including: an eye examination – to look at the structures of your eyes in more detail and check for abnormalities an ultrasound scan of your eye – a small probe placed over your closed eye uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your eye; this allows your doctor to find out more about the position of the tumour and its size a fluorescein angiogram – where photographs of the suspected cancer are taken using a special camera after dye has been injected into your bloodstream to highlight the tumour Occasionally, a thin needle may be used to remove a small sample of cells from the tumour (biopsy). The genetic information in these cells is analysed to give an indication of the chances of the cancer spreading or coming back. Treatments for eye melanoma Treatment for melanoma of the eye depends on the size and location of the tumour. Your care team will explain each treatment option in detail, including the benefits and any potential complications. Treatment will aim to conserve the affected eye whenever possible. The main treatments for eye melanoma are: brachytherapy – tiny plates lined with radioactive material called plaques are inserted near the tumour and left in place for up to a week to kill the cancerous cells external radiotherapy – a machine is used to carefully aim beams of radiation at the tumour to kill the cancerous cells surgery to remove the tumour or part of the eye – this may be possible if the tumour is small and you still have some vision in your eye removal of the eye (enucleation) – this may be necessary if the tumour is large or you have lost your vision; the eye will eventually be replaced with an artificial eye that matches your other eye immunotherapy – medicine to help your immune system kill cancer, which you may have if you have a certain type of eye melanoma, or if the cancer has spread to other parts of your body Chemotherapy is rarely used for eye melanoma, but may be suitable for other types of eye cancer. More information Cancer Research UK: treatment options for eye cancer Cancer Research UK: types of eye cancer surgery Outlook for eye melanoma The outlook for melanoma of the eye depends on many factors. Eye cancer is rare, so survival rates are based on all eye cancers. For people with eye cancer in England: 95 out of every 100 (95%) will live at least 1 year after diagnosis 70 out of every 100 (70%) will live at least 5 years after diagnosis 60 out of every 100 (60%) will live at least 10 years after diagnosis There is more information about eye cancer survival on the Cancer Research UK website.

It's important to get treatment because it can sometimes affect your sight. Symptoms of a herpes simplex eye infection Herpes simplex eye infections usually affect only one eye. The symptoms can be similar to some other eye conditions, and can include: eye pain a red eye watering of your eye sensitivity to light blurred vision or other changes to your eyesight a swollen eyelid blisters or a rash on your eyelid or the skin around your eye It's more likely to be a herpes simplex eye infection if you've had one before, or if you've had cold sores. If you keep getting herpes simplex eye infections they may become less painful. If you're not sure it's a herpes simplex eye infection Find out about other conditions that can cause: a red eye eyelid problems watering eyes Non-urgent advice: See a GP or go to an opticians if: you have a red eye with no pain for more than a few days You can get treatment on the NHS for some eye conditions at some opticians – check before you make an appointment. If it's not clear what's causing your red eye, you may be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for tests. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have eye pain you have a red eye that's getting worse you have any changes to your eyesight, such as blurred vision you have a swollen, irritated eyelid that has not got better It might not be anything serious, but it's best to get help as it may need to be treated quickly. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if: You have a red eye and: it hurts to look at light your eye is very dark red one pupil is bigger than the other Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatment for herpes simplex eye infections If a GP thinks you have a herpes simplex eye infection they'll refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). You'll usually be seen the same day so that you can start treatment quickly. You'll usually be prescribed either: an antiviral medicine such as aciclovir, taken as eye ointment, eye drops or sometimes tablets antiviral medicine with steroid eye drops to reduce swelling Most infections will get better with treatment in a couple of weeks and will not permanently affect your eyesight. It's common for herpes simplex eye infections to come back. If you keep getting them a doctor might recommend that you take antiviral tablets every day to help prevent infections. If treatment does not work or you keep getting the infections, your cornea (the transparent front part of your eye) might become scarred, causing sight loss. If this happens you might need to have a cornea transplant. Information: If you use contact lenses, do not wear them until 24 hours after all your symptoms have gone. How you get herpes simplex eye infections Most herpes simplex eye infections are caused by the same herpes simplex virus that causes cold sores. You usually get the herpes simplex virus from skin to skin contact from someone with a cold sore. Once you have it, it stays in your body. It does not usually cause any symptoms, but sometimes it can cause eye infections. This is more likely if you have a weakened immune system. It might also be triggered by an illness, stress, exposure to bright light or an eye injury. You're unlikely to pass the virus on to someone else from an eye infection, but try to avoid touching your eye, and wash your hands regularly.

    "text": "Long-sightedness Long-sightedness is where you find it hard to see things nearby, but you can see things far away clearly. It’s a common condition and wearing glasses or contact lenses can usually correct your vision. Long-sightedness is also known as hypermetropia or hyperopia. Symptoms of long-sightedness Long-sightedness can happen at any age, but often affects people over 40. Symptoms of long-sightedness include: finding it hard to see nearby things, for example, words and pictures in books or on screens may look fuzzy being able to see things more clearly when you move them further away from your eyes tired eyes after tasks that involve looking at something closely, like reading or working at a computer headaches Non-urgent advice: Go to an opticians if: you or your child have signs of long-sightedness Find an opticians What happens during an eye test To check if you or your child is long-sighted a specialist called an optometrist will usually do an eye test. You’ll be asked to look at lights or read letters while different lenses are placed in front of your eyes. This helps the optometrist find out how well your vision is working. The optometrist will usually shine a light into your eyes to check the back of your eyes are healthy. They may give you eyedrops which helps them to get a better look. Information: NHS eye tests NHS eye tests are free for some people including: children under 16 years, or under 19 years and in full-time education people aged 60 or over people who are registered blind or partially sighted people who have diabetes or glaucoma people on some benefits, including Universal Credit Find out more about free NHS eye tests and optical vouchers Treatments for long-sightedness Glasses and contact lenses Long-sightedness can usually be treated with glasses or contact lenses. These help your eyes focus correctly so you can see nearby objects clearly. Your optician will give you advice on the best options to treat your long-sightedness. Contact lenses are usually only suitable for adults and may not be suitable for everyone. Help with the cost of glasses and contact lenses Laser and lens surgery Some people with long-sightedness may be able to have laser eye surgery or lens replacement surgery to correct their vision. Both types of surgery are carried out while you are awake, using local anaesthetic, so you will not feel any pain. Laser eye surgery is where high-energy beams of light (lasers) are used to reshape the surface of the eye (the cornea) to correct the way your eye focuses. Lens surgery is where the lens inside your eye is replaced with a plastic implant to correct your vision. Ask your optician if laser or lens surgery may be options for you. These treatments are not usually available on the NHS. Find out more about laser eye surgery and lens surgery Causes of long-sightedness Long-sightedness happens when the eyes cannot focus properly. This can be because of: the shape of your eye the shape of the front layer of your eye (the cornea) the lens inside your eye has become stiffer, usually due to aging (presbyopia) Long-sightedness is often passed on from your parents and cannot be prevented. It can also be caused by other conditions like diabetes and eye cancer, but this is very rare. Complications of long-sightedness If left untreated, long-sightedness may cause other vision problems. Young children with severe long-sightedness are more likely to develop other eye problems, including lazy eye and squint.

    "text": "Short-sightedness (myopia) Short-sightedness (myopia) is a very common eye condition where you cannot see objects far away clearly. It's usually corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Symptoms of short-sightedness Short-sightedness usually starts in children from age 6 to 13. It can also happen in adults. Signs you or your child may be short-sighted include: difficulty reading words from a distance, such as reading the whiteboard at school sitting close to the TV or computer, or holding a mobile phone or tablet close to the face getting headaches rubbing the eyes a lot Short-sightedness often runs in families, so you may have relatives who are also short-sighted. It can get worse until the eye has stopped growing, at around 20 years of age. Non-urgent advice: Go to an opticians if: you or your child has signs of short-sightedness you or your child has not had an eye test for 2 years What happens during an eye test To check if you or your child is short-sighted, an eye test specialist called an optometrist will usually do an eye test. You'll be asked to look at a light or read letters on a chart while different lenses are placed in front of your eyes. To check the health of your eyes, you or your child may be given special eyedrops so the optometrist can see the back of your eye more clearly. If you or your child needs glasses, you'll be given a prescription. You can take this to any optician.

There are 2 different types of surgery: laser surgery to reshape the front of the eye lens surgery to replace the lenses in your eyes with artificial lenses This type of surgery is not available on the NHS and can be expensive. Find out more about laser eye surgery and lens surgery How to stop short-sightedness getting worse It's not clear why short-sightedness happens and it's hard to prevent it. But there are some things that can help stop it getting worse. These include: spending more time outdoors (especially children) wearing bi-focal or multi-focal contact lenses An optometrist may talk to you about specially designed glasses or contact lenses for your child, which may help slow down the development of myopia. This is called myopia management or myopia control. But it's not available on the NHS as more research is needed. Find out more about myopia in children on The College of Optometrists website. Some opticians may advise wearing a special lens overnight (orthokeratology). This can help you see better without glasses or contact lenses. If you're worried about your or your child's eyesight getting worse, talk to an optician. Complications of short-sightedness Young children with untreated short-sightedness are more likely to get other conditions, such as: a squint – where the eyes point in different directions a lazy eye – where sight in 1 eye does not develop properly Some adults with severe short sight-sightedness are more likely to develop: glaucoma – increased pressure inside the eyes detached retina – where the thin layer at the back of your eye (retina) becomes loose; this needs urgent treatment to prevent losing your sight cataracts – cloudy patches inside the lens of the eye Page last reviewed: 10 May 2022 Next review due: 10 May 2025 Help us improve our website Can you answer a 5 minute survey about your visit today?

Retinal migraines are less common than other types of migraine. Symptoms of a retinal migraine Retinal migraines usually affect 1 eye. They often come on suddenly and symptoms include: vision loss – this usually lasts around 10 to 20 minutes but can sometimes last up to 1 hour a blind spot in your vision a headache – you may get this at the same time as the eye symptoms or shortly afterwards other eye symptoms, such as blurred vision and seeing flashing lights, zigzag patterns or coloured spots or lines feeling sick or being sick Sometimes you can get the eye symptoms without having a headache. Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have vision problems, such as a blind spot in your vision, for the first time You can call 111 or get help from 111 online. Non-urgent advice: See a GP if: You have retinal migraines and: they're getting worse you're getting them more often there's a change to your usual symptoms Immediate action required: Call 999 if: you have a headache that came on suddenly and is extremely painful you suddenly have problems speaking or remembering things you have sudden vision loss, blurred vision or double vision you suddenly feel dizzy, drowsy or confused you have a seizure or fit you have a high temperature with a stiff neck, pain when looking at bright lights, pale and blotchy skin or a rash that does not fade when you roll a glass over it you have sudden weakness in your arms or legs on 1 side of your body, or 1 side of your face These are signs of more serious conditions and you need to get immediate medical help. Information: Do not drive yourself to A&E. The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. Treatments for retinal migraine Treatment for retinal migraines is not usually needed if you do not have them very often. If you have them frequently, a GP may suggest: trying to avoid things that cause your migraines, such as cutting down on caffeine or alcohol painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen medicines to stop you feeling sick or being sick medicines to help prevent migraines, such as topiramate or amitriptyline a few weeks of acupuncture If these treatments do not help control your migraines, you may be referred to a specialist called a neurologist for more tests and treatment. Causes of retinal migraine Retinal migraines are thought to happen when the blood vessels in your eye suddenly narrow, restricting the blood flow. Things that can cause them include: stress caffeine and alcohol dehydration smoking high blood pressure bending over low blood sugar some types of hormonal contraception Keeping a record of when you get migraines in a diary can help you work out what might be causing them.

It can cause serious brain problems if it's not treated quickly. Symptoms of Reye's syndrome Symptoms of Reye's syndrome often start 1 to 3 weeks after a child recovers from a virus like flu or chickenpox. The child may: keep being sick (vomiting) be drowsy and lack energy feel confused have changes in their behaviour, such as being irritable or aggressive breathe quickly and have a fast heart rate have fits (seizures) lose consciousness Reye's syndrome most commonly affects children between 5 and 14 years of age. Younger and older children can also sometimes get it, but it's very rare in babies under the age of 1 and in those over the age of 18. Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if your child: has a fit or seizure is finding it difficult to breathe is confused is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face) loses consciousness Find your nearest A&E Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: your child keeps being sick (vomiting) your child is drowsy or lacks energy your child is not their normal self – for example, they're irritable or aggressive Check symptoms on 111 online (for children aged 5 or over) or call 111 (for children under 5). Tell the GP or person you speak to if your child has recently had an infection like flu or chickenpox and if they've taken aspirin. What happens at your appointment If there's a chance your child might have Reye's syndrome, they'll be referred to a specialist for some tests. Tests may include: blood and urine tests a CT scan and an electroencephalogram (EEG) a lumbar puncture – where a thin needle is inserted into their lower back to remove a small amount of spinal fluid for testing a liver biopsy – where a small sample of cells from the liver is taken for testing Treatments for Reye's syndrome If your child has Reye's syndrome, they'll need to go into hospital straight away for treatment. Treatments for Reye's syndrome may include: help with breathing using an oxygen machine fluids given directly into a vein to help prevent dehydration medicines to help treat and manage symptoms Most children with Reye's syndrome make a full recovery if it's treated quickly. But some children can have long-term brain problems. Causes of Reye's syndrome The exact cause of Reye's syndrome is unknown. It's been linked to the use of a type of medicine known as salicylates, particularly aspirin, in young people and children under 16. Sometimes a child with a rare genetic condition, such as medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), can get Reye's syndrome. This has nothing to do with the use of aspirin. Preventing Reye's syndrome There are things you can do to reduce your child's chance of getting Reye's syndrome. Do think about getting your child vaccinated against flu and other common viruses Don’t do not give aspirin to children under the age of 16, unless their doctor prescribes it do not give children under 16 any medicines that contain salicylic acid or salicylate, which includes some mouth ulcer gels – ask a pharmacist for advice about alternatives suitable for children Page last reviewed: 14 September 2023 Next review due: 14 September 2026 Help us improve our website Can you answer a 5 minute survey about your visit today?

Goals and outcome measures Background information Management Supporting evidence How this topic was developed References Management Scenario: Topical treatment Scenario: Intranasal corticosteroid treatment Scenario: Eye treatment Background information Definition Action of local corticosteroids Availability Corticosteroids - topical (skin), nose, and eyes: Summary Corticosteroids are synthetic analogues of the natural hormones that are produced by the adrenal cortex. Local corticosteroids are predominantly glucocorticoids. They have four main effects: Anti-inflammatory. Immunosuppressive. Anti-proliferative (anti-mitotic). Vasoconstrictive. Topical corticosteroids exert these effects on the skin: Eczema — the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects are important. Psoriasis — is characterized by rapid cell turnover, and the anti-mitotic effects are important. Intranasal corticosteroids exert these effects on the nasal mucosa. They relieve or prevent the symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis. They can also be used in the short term to shrink nasal polyps. Corticosteroid eye preparations control inflammation of the eye due to allergy, trauma, or infection. The length of treatment with topical corticosteroids depends on the diagnosis. Generally, very potent corticosteroids should not be used at any site for more than 4 weeks continuously, and potent corticosteroids should not be used continuously at any site for longer than 8 weeks. If treatment is indicated for longer, intermittent dosing and gradual tapering of the dose should be considered, and more frequent monitoring for adverse effects should be arranged. Adults using intermittent or short term courses of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids, and children using topical corticosteroids of any potency should be offered an annual review to assess for steroid atrophy and other adverse effects. Topical corticosteroids should be avoided in people with bacterial, fungal, or viral skin lesions; rosacea; perioral dermatitis; acne vulgaris; or anogenital pruritus, and they should not be used indiscriminately for the treatment of itch. Local adverse effects of topical corticosteroids occur mostly on the face, in skin folds, and in areas that are treated long term. Adverse effects include: Transient burning or stinging. Skin atrophy. Permanent striae. Acne vulgaris (or worsening of existing acne) or rosacea. Intranasal corticosteroids: Are more likely to cause systemic adverse effects when delivered by intranasal drops compared with sprays. Should not be used in the presence of untreated nasal infections; after nasal surgery before healing has occurred, unless on specialist advice; or if there is pulmonary tuberculosis. Local adverse effects from intranasal corticosteroids include dryness, irritation, and nosebleeds. If adverse effects are severe, this may require stopping treatment temporarily. Skin erythema and rash, itching, headache, and disturbance of smell and taste may also occur. Corticosteroid eye preparations: Should always be initiated in secondary care. Treatment may be continued and monitored in primary care following a specialist management plan. May cause increased intraocular pressure, leading to corticosteroid-induced glaucoma. May cause corticosteroid-induced cataract if use is prolonged. Should not be used with soft contact lenses — lenses should be removed before instillation of drops, and not worn during the period of treatment.

Print this page Summary Have I got the right topic? How up-to-date is this topic? Goals and outcome measures Background information Diagnosis Management Supporting evidence How this topic was developed References Diagnosis Diagnosis Assessment Differential diagnosis Management Scenario: Management Background information Definition Causes Prevalence Prognosis Complications Dry eye disease: Summary Dry eye disease (or 'dry eye syndrome' or 'keratoconjunctivitis sicca') is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film with reduced tear production or tear film instability, associated with ocular discomfort and/or visual symptoms. There are two main types that often overlap and co-exist: Evaporative dry eye (more common) — increased tear film evaporation, most often due to a deficient lipid layer in the tear film. Aqueous deficient dry eye — reduced aqueous secretion from lacrimal glands causing a reduced tear volume. There are multiple possible causes of dry eye including Meibomian gland dysfunction, blepharitis, age-related changes, lid aperture disorders, primary or secondary Sjögren’s syndrome, rosacea, reduced blink interval, environmental factors, and iatrogenic causes including contact lens use, longterm topical eye preparation use, systemic medications, and post eye surgery or radiation. Dry eye disease is usually a chronic condition with fluctuating severity and variable duration, depending on the underlying cause. Complications include impact on daily activities including driving, reading, and sleep; anxiety and depression; corneal scarring, ulceration, infection, and perforation; or severe visual loss (rare). A diagnosis of dry eye should be suspected if there are: Symptoms of eye irritation, itching, or discomfort; eye dryness; transient blurring of vision; and watery eyes. Signs such as mild conjunctival redness or mucous discharge. Assessment of a person with suspected dry eye disease should include: Asking about symptom onset, severity, duration, and fluctuation; impact on quality of life; any red flags; possible underlying causes or exacerbating factors; ocular history; current medication; and previous treatments. Examination for visual acuity; red flag signs; typical signs of dry eye; abnormal lid anatomy or function; eyelid inflammation or deposits; and cranial nerves and skin for signs of other underlying conditions. Management of a person with dry eye disease should include: Advising on sources of information and support. Advising on lifestyle measures for symptom relief, such as warm compresses, lid hygiene, and lid massage for blepharitis or Meibomian gland dysfunction; modification of contact lens use and environmental factors such as avoiding prolonged digital device use or exposure to air conditioning/drafts. Reducing or stopping contributory drug treatment if possible. Optimizing management of any associated ocular or systemic conditions. Advising on the use of tear substitutes and arranging review if needed. Specialist referral of a person with dry eye disease should be arranged if: There are red flag symptoms or signs suggesting a serious or sight-threatening cause for dry eye (same-day ophthalmology assessment). A serious underlying cause or complication is suspected (urgent ophthalmology referral). There is an uncertain diagnosis. There is a suspected underlying systemic condition such as Sjögren’s syndrome. There is abnormal lid anatomy or function. There are persistent or severe symptoms which do not respond to primary care management after 4–12 weeks.

It is important to differentiate whether the person presenting with red eye needs same-day assessment by an ophthalmologist, urgent assessment, or if they can be safely managed in primary care. Serious and potentially sight-threatening causes of red eye include: Acute glaucoma. Anterior uveitis. Corneal ulcer, contact lens-related red eye and corneal foreign body. Neonatal conjunctivitis. Trauma, such as penetrating eye injury or high-velocity foreign body. Chemical injuries. Scleritis. Endophthalmitis. Assessment of a person with red eye involves taking a history and performing an examination. History should include onset and duration of symptoms, whether these are unilateral or bilateral, associated symptoms (visual changes, pain, foreign body sensation, discharge, or photophobia), use of contact lenses, any trauma or chemical exposure, previous episodes, and relevant past medical history and medication. Examination should include inspection, assessment of visual acuity, fluorescein examination, and pupil reactions. Features in the history and examination which can indicate there is a serious cause of the person's red eye, and therefore that same-day ophthalmology assessment is required, include: Reduced visual acuity.

Summary Have I got the right topic? How up-to-date is this topic? Goals and outcome measures Background information Diagnosis Management Supporting evidence How this topic was developed References Diagnosis Diagnosis Assessment Differential diagnosis Management Scenario: Management of suspected retinal detachment Background information Definition Prevalence Risk factors Prognosis Complications Retinal detachment: Summary Retinal detachment refers to the separation of the inner neurosensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium, which allows vitreous fluid to accumulate in the subretinal space. The separation results in progressive loss of vision and can lead to permanent visual loss in the affected eye. There are three types of retinal detachment: Rhegmatogenous detachment is the most common form. As the vitreous shrinks and partly separates from the retinal surface, a retinal tear or break may develop. Continuing traction by the vitreous on the retinal surface allows fluid to enter the subretinal space, causing retinal detachment. Exudative detachment is caused by leakage of fluid into the subretinal space, often due to inflammation or malignancy. Tractional detachment is most commonly seen in people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, where abnormal vasculature causes contraction of the vitreous, which then pulls on the underlying retina. Retinal detachment is one of the most common eye emergencies in the UK, with an annual incidence of about 10–15 per 100,000 people. Men present more commonly with retinal detachment secondary to trauma. Risk factors include myopia, family history of retinal break or detachment, eye trauma, cataract surgery, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. If left untreated, symptomatic retinal detachment invariably results in permanent loss of vision. Prompt recognition and referral may allow early surgical repair before the macula is detached, reducing the risk of permanent visual impairment. Retinal detachment should be suspected if there is one or more of: New onset of floaters. New onset of flashes. Sudden-onset painless and usually progressive visual field loss. A reduction in visual acuity, blurred or distorted vision, causing persistent and progressive visual loss. If a person is experiencing new-onset flashes and/or floaters and a diagnosis of retinal detachment is suspected, management involves: Arranging immediate referral to an ophthalmologist with retinal surgery expertise to be seen on the same day, if there are symptoms or signs of sight-threatening disease, such as visual field loss or changes in visual acuity, or fundoscopic signs of retinal detachment or vitreous haemorrhage. Arranging urgent referral to a practitioner competent in the use of slit lamp examination and indirect ophthalmoscopy to be seen within 24 hours, if there are no symptoms or signs of sight-threatening disease. Offering information and advice on driving safety, the early warning signs of possible future retinal tear or detachment, and use of eye protection when doing at-risk sports.
