##  About the Project

This application is a sophisticated proof-of-concept developed for a dissertation project to explore the use of Large Language Models in clinical decision support. It is designed to assist in the initial triage of emergency eye-related symptoms by conducting an intelligent, multi-turn conversation with a user.

The system's knowledge base is grounded in authoritative clinical sources, including **Kanskiâ€™s Clinical Ophthalmology**, to ensure its questions and assessments are clinically relevant and safe.

*Disclaimer: This is an academic proof-of-concept and is not a certified medical device. It does not provide medical advice.*

##  Key Features

* **Intelligent Dialogue:** Asks a series of clarifying questions to understand symptoms fully, guided by a sophisticated `RouterAgent`.
* **Clinically Grounded:** Uses a FAISS vector database to retrieve context from trusted medical texts, ensuring responses are based on facts, not just the LLM's general knowledge.
* **Structured Summaries:** Provides a final summary with a clear urgency recommendation (Urgent, Semi-Urgent, or Routine) and a justification.
* **Robust Safety Rails:** Includes checks for off-topic queries, irrelevant user answers, and a maximum question limit to prevent conversational loops.

##  Technology Stack

* **Backend & Logic:** Python, LangChain
* **AI Model:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash
